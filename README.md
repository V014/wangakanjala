# Wanga Kanjala portfolio

This is a portfolio website, listing and describing my skill set via a more user friendly apporach. I have been trying to reach out to a wide range of people
possibly clients or collaborators, this is one of the attempts before I beleive the whole world is agaisn't my hustle. The work I do is not for fun and I take it
seriously and aim to set the bar higher when interacting with what I have to offer before time is lost.
